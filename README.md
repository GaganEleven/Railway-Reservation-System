# Railway-Reservation-System
The project is divided into two segments:
  1. User-Oriented- 
     The application software can be used for reservation and cancellation of railway tickets. 
     User can also view their current reservation status using system generated PNR ID and can also check the train details. 
     
  2. Administration- 
     It includes administrative rights such as updating of train details (arrival time, standard fare, availability, seat status etc), deletion and modification of general user entries.
